# The Schematics of Computation

This directory contains my Racket versions of some of the code examples from the book [The Schematics of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Schematics-Computation-Vincent-Manis/dp/0138342849).

I chose Racket because the documentation is better, there is a larger community, and some more modern language features. Subjectively I think the syntax is more readable as well. Omission of boilerplate `lambda` and `being` is nice too.
