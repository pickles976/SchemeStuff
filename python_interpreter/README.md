# Python Scheme Interpreter

This Scheme Interpreter was built following [this guide](https://norvig.com/lispy.html)
with a refactored tokenizer following [this guide](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html)

The tokenizer was refactored to allow for strings with spaces, and also to reduce my reliance on some of Python's built-in tools.
